# Consumption

The inference service expects an input JSON file similar to `input.json`. Alternatively, the values can also be passed directly as a string.

To run the inference service, simply run `predict.sh`.

```bash
bash predict.sh
```

**NOTE**: Just like the deployment script, ensure that you replace the value of model name with the appropriate values.
